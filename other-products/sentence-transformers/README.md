# [SentenceTransformers](https://www.sbert.net/)

SentenceTransformers is a Python framework for state-of-the-art sentence, text, and image embeddings. You can use this framework to compute sentence / text embeddings for more than 100 languages. These embeddings can then be compared e.g. with cosine-similarity to find sentences with a similar meaning. This can be useful for semantic textual similarity, semantic search, or paraphrase mining.

## Getting Started

SentenceTransformers is very straightforward to use, just follow the [documentation](https://www.sbert.net/) to install the Python library and then you can pretty much get going.

## Other Resources

- You can then store the embedding vectors computed by SentenceTransformers into something like [LanceDB](../../challenge-sponsors/lancedb/README.md) to perform interesting search and retrieval tasks.
