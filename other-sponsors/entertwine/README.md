# Opener

Welcome Attendees! This is an exciting moment in innovation. We're at the infancy of sci-fi brilliance (at least I think so). We're more than thrilled to see all the projects that come from using e.e.r.s.

## Overview

e.e.r.s. is an AI recommendation engine created by the company entertwine. With e.e.r.s. users can recommend/match/filter data in seconds with no current limit to the number of data points. 

## Core Features
 - Compare two data sets to get the best match
- Add rules and restrictions to data sets to modify your results
- Compare multiple data entries with ease

## Special for Amplitude's hackathon

Hackers using e.e.r.s. to build have free access (for a limited time). Download our SDK and start building.
