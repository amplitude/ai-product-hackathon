# [Modal](https://modal.com/): End-to-end cloud compute

Welcome, Amplitude Hackathon attendees! Modal is thrilled to be a sponsor of this exciting event, and we can't wait to see the AI-powered applications you'll create using our API.

Modal makes serverless compute magically easy. You can deploy an inference endpoint, a cron job, a web app, or run massively parallel experiments with a few lines of code. Deploy and iterate on your code in seconds, without having to mess with yaml or Kubernetes.

## Core Features

Modal offers inference, batch jobs, task queues, web apps and more. All without your own infrastructure.:

- **Cloud power, local productivity**: Run your code in the cloud within seconds. No need to install Docker, set up Kubernetes clusters, or even have an AWS account.
- **Built from scratch for high performance**: A brand new container runtime written in Rust, specifically designed for modern-day use cases.
- **Infinite use cases**: You create it, we run it. Explore the use cases that align with your goals.
- **Seamless infrastructure**: Deploy from a local machine to the cloud with just two additional lines of code.
- **Top-notch speed**: Run code in the cloud with the same instant feedback loop you have when you develop locally. Launch hundreds of containers of a freshly-built image within seconds.
