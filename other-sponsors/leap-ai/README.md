# [Leap](http://tryleap.ai/): A Single API for Everything AI

Welcome, Amplitude Hackathon attendees! Leap is thrilled to be a sponsor of this exciting event, and we can't wait to see the AI-powered applications you'll create using our API.

Leap is designed to help developers like you seamlessly add AI features to your apps. With our API, you can build innovative applications like on-demand backgrounds/headers, custom art, visual assets, such as icons and gaming assets, and so much more.

## Core Features

Leap offers an extensive, powerful set of features to help you create the best AI-enhanced apps possible:

- **Image Generation**: Type what you want, and our AI will generate a custom image for you. This feature is perfect for adding on-demand backgrounds/headers, creating art, developing visual assets like icons and gaming assets, and much more.
- **Image Remixing**: Remix can be used for both sketch-to-image and image-to-image transformations. Draw something and get a real image, or take an existing image and remix it into something else. Convert a selfie into a custom avatar, or change the style of a photo of an apartment completely. The possibilities are endless!
- **Model Training**: Teach the AI about custom subjects, such as people, objects, or pets, and then generate new images that include the custom subjects you just taught it. This feature allows you to create uniquely tailored AI experiences for your specific use cases.
