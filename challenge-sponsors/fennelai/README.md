## What is Fennel.ai?

[Fennel.ai](https://docs.fennel.ai/) is a fully managed realtime feature engineering platform that empowers data science/ML teams to move lot faster and minimize data quality issues in their ML features.

### Challenge

Fennel.ai is excited to announce a hackathon challenge to revolutionize the world of feature engineering! The challenge is to build an innovative auto-feature engineering tool that can analyze various datasets and automatically identify the most valuable features for a given task. By generating a list of relevant features, your tool can help data scientists come up with better feature engineering ideas / help kagglers build better models.

The challenge aims to develop an auto feature engineering tool that can process various datasets, identify relevant features for a task. Bonus points if it could rank features by importance/ offer data visualizations for better understanding of feature significance.
